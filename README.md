## Overview
Novella brings emotion back to online connection. Beyond swipes and static chat, it blends ambient bio-signals and subtle cues to make conversations feel alive — and safe, inclusive, and consent-driven. The vision includes a shared AR garden that grows with your bond, on-device mood hints, and wearable-powered **Heart Sync**.

---

## Core Features
- **Profiles** — Create your profile, explore others, and connect.  
- **Flutter / Pass** — Tap **Flutter** to show interest; **Pass** hides a profile permanently.  
- **Heart Sync (opt-in)** — Wearable BPM turns into live butterfly flutters; when hearts align, a DNA swirl & butterfly burst appear.  
- **Chat with Cues** — “Nervousness/Shyness” via typing rhythm & pauses; ambient petals while browsing.  
- **Amora (Relationship Chatbot)** — Openers, ice-breakers, and gentle check-ins.  
- **Voice Mood Analyzer** — On-device tone cues (e.g., pollen = flirty, mist = calm).  
- **Symbiosis Garden (AR)** — A shared garden that unlocks rare butterflies as conversations deepen.  
- **Ghost Glimpse** — Spontaneous photos with blurred previews; **reply to unlock**, then they **fade after one view** (ephemeral, privacy-first).

## Getting Started

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanaya27/Novella-App.git
cd Novella-App

2) Install dependencies
# Frontend
cd novella-app
npm install

# Backend (optional, if used)
cd ../novella-backend
npm install

3) Configure environment

Create .env files as needed (see Configuration
).

4) Run locally
# Web app
cd novella-app
npm run dev   # or: npm start (match your package.json)

# Backend (optional)
cd ../novella-backend
npm run dev   # or: npm start

Configuration

Novella requires at least one AI provider key for the Amora chatbot to generate realistic chat responses.

Quick setup
cd novella-app
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and add at least one key
npm start

Environment Variables

| Variable                      | Required | Provider           |

Privacy & Safety

Consent by default — Heart Sync & Voice Mood are opt-in.

On-device first — Derive mood locally; send only labels (e.g., “calm/energetic”), not raw audio.

Ephemeral media — Ghost Glimpse is designed to vanish after a single view.

User control — Block/report, export data, delete account.

Security — TLS in transit; encrypt sensitive fields at rest.

Transparency — Document retention windows & third-party processors in PRIVACY.md (coming soon).

Roadmap

Mobile app (React Native + Expo) with wearable Heart Sync (HealthKit / Google Fit)

3D Symbiosis Garden (Three.js) + AR (ARKit/ARCore) with unlockable species

Safety toolkit: in-chat reporting, auto-blur sensitive media

Accessibility: VoiceOver/TalkBack, dynamic type, high-contrast

Localization: multi-language & RTL support

FAQ

Does Heart Sync share my raw heartbeat?
No. With consent, devices read BPM; only derived visuals (flutters, DNA swirl) are shown in chat — not raw BPM streams.

Is Voice Mood recording me?
No. Analysis is intended to run on-device; if any label is sent, it’s categorical only (e.g., “calm”).

Can I disable analytics or cues?
Yes — ship with toggles so users can disable mood/heartbeat cues entirely.

What happens to Ghost Glimpse after viewing?
It fades after one view. External capture is still possible; discourage misuse and allow reporting. (Implement server-side deletion & signed URLs with short TTLs.)
